## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

For prepare data file, create folder 'data' at project root, put data file 'survey_results_public.csv' and 'survey_results_schema.csv' in it.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2018 to better understand:

1. What's the distribution of gender, age, salary, country and so on?
2. What factors about an individual contributed to salary?
3. Did hard-work connected with salary? Did satisfacation connected with salary

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
